## **Press Release:**

InsureZen ANNOUNCES AN INTEGRATED APPLICATION TO HELP MEMBERS WITH SMOOTH OPERATION OF MEDICAL & INSURANCE ACCOUNTS.

“SEATTLE-October 12, 2023 – LIFETIME HEALTH, a Seattle based Insurance Company, today announced a new mobile application that allows user’s multiple medical accounts to manage the providers, records, and insurance related services and resources collectively.

“An average member uses multiple care-giver accounts for himself and his family and keeping up all those accounts at different portals is a tedious task and demands of work, coupled with numerous other responsibilities. Its unimaginable to remember all the appointments of everyone in the family. Organizing all the health records and documentation is not easy when physical copies can easily be misplaced. For any outstanding bill, spending time looking through hundreds of daily emails and texts just to find the one from your provider, is overwhelming and directly impacts user credit score if transferred to the collection agency.

InsureZen solves user’s pain-points by letting user handle individual/family account. User can upload documents and health records, select the insurance type, in-network providers, and settle bills all using the mobile application. No more missing out on appointments and outstanding payments from now. The app. will  alert the user with timely notifications and reminders for every single activity.

“Additionally, the app will allow user to access, store and review all the health records or reports from last week, month or year. Online check-ins to save time during appointments. Co-pay bills and other invoices stored  from all the providers (mentioning you and your family members) under each patient’s name to have better transparency and better management of all your medical accounts with this comprehensive application.

“Our goal with this application is to make smooth handling of everything related to the healthcare. There are many people who have expressed their frustration about having multiple portals and managing them timely. This will help customers to access all the records, bills and even the providers at one place and will help them from no-shows at their appointments.” Said the head of operations.

To get onboard with this application, download it for iOS and Android and get started. Log-in and get started. Select your insurance and healthcare provider, fill-in your details like bank account for auto-pay, pharmacies, and addresses. Review the details and this application will alert you with all the relevant notifications related to your appointments, billings, and re-fills etc. You can easily add your family members and have a joint account for better efficiency and hassle-free experience.

“ I am grateful for this app, as in past my bill went to collection without even getting contacted directly by the hospital due to misunderstanding and effected my credit score, now I am relieved about that and able to keep up with all my appointments and outstanding bills at one place.”
