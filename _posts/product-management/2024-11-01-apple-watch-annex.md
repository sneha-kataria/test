A rise in percentage of people suffering from panic attacks estimated currently 4% of the world’s population especially

exceeds certain standards, the wrist band will start putting pressure and massaging the wrist to distract and comfort
the user.  Addition to that, Siri will be set in motion by offering an AI-assisted one-on-one chat to comfort the user
during the panic attack. Siri will initiate the music playlist  to take user’s mind off of the stress causing the
attack and will begin slideshows of featured picture from the photos for calming the user with happy memories. If the
situation persists for more than 15 min, an automatic SOS alert call will be sent to the family or the emergency
contacts saved for the feature.

“Users can track their everyday activity through the daily highlights and can view weekly, monthly and annual records
for better assessment of one’s situation.” says the VP of Health Department. “This breakthrough service can also be 
used in more casual, less dire circumstances,” William said. “So, if you’re out on a long hike, or alone in your 
apartment, this app manages the user’s condition at the same time notifying the situation to user’s emergency contacts.”
