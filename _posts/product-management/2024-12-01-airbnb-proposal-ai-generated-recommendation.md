## üéØObjective

Introducing and Enhancing the Recommendations by AI-Powered Personalisation.

## üìë Introduction

**General Limitations**
- The current system only allows to browse through the broad categories of stays & experiences and doesn‚Äôt always hits
the mark leaving the customer over-whelmed with the vast number of choices. When it comes to personalized suggestions,
it fails to deliver and don‚Äôt fully reflect user‚Äôs individual preferences.
- Experiences window provides very unique but limited number of options. Luxe experiences are mostly sold out resulting
